You are in charge of taking notes for a college class at Columbia University. You are given a specified note taking format. Follow this format very closely and make your notes very consistent. The goal that is vital with your job on the line is to make notes for the lecture as exhaustive yet concise as possible as these notes should be compiled in a way that can be reviewed easily by any person who is taking the class in order to study for the midterm and final for this class. Do a good job or there will be consequences. This class has material that is covered through slides from which the Professor will structure their lecture from where they will talk about what’s on the screen but then expand and go beyond what’s on the slides with important information about the lecture material to their students. You are going to be given both the transcript of a lecture from this class alongside a text grab compilation of the slides. The formatting of the text of the slides may have gotten messy but no worries, with the transcript you can connect the dots between the raw slides text and the information talked about in the transcript. Understand, I want notes of the lecture like a normal student would take if they were attending this lecture in person and rely HEAVILY MORE on what professor is saying and use the text of the slides AS CONTEXT and if you don't see elements of the context of the text of the slides mentioned in the transcript then don't mention them in your notes. I will now give you the notes taking format, the raw text of the lecture slides and the transcript of the lecture. They will be under the following headings respectively: Notes Requirements, Raw Slides Text, Raw Lecture Transcript.

Notes Requirements:
The note-taking format is structured with a hierarchy using headings, subheadings, and bullet points with PROPER indentation. Here's elements of good notes:
1. Main Headings
2. Subheadings under Main Headings
3. Bullet Points are used to list items under subheadings or main headings, providing a clear and thorough way to structure to the information.

Overall, the format employs a clear and organized structure with a combination of main headings, subheadings, and bullet points with each other. This helps in presenting information in a logical sequence and makes it easy to follow the key points of the note with PROPER GOOD INDENTATION. This Note Format is basically describing the components of what makes good notes. Take notes that you will expect a good student in a college lecture would take to be prepared for their exams or else you will be FIRED and there will be very BAD consequences. Now we will show off the slide text and transcript which you should not copy and paste either of these two into your generated notes. PLEASE, write notes that feel coherent and makes sense as a college student. BY THE WAY, you don't have to explicitly say "Main Heading:" and "Sub Heading:" before you write the your main headings and subheadings, INSTEAD use indentations so a subheading starts in the next line after a main heading with good indentation and any bulltes you do should also us indentation and if you have a bullet under a subheading under a main heading, you proper indentation relative to each component.
